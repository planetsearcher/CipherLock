# CipherLock

**Homomorphic data vault with Zama FHEVM**

CipherLock provides secure, encrypted storage where data remains protected even during processing. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine, the platform enables computations over encrypted data without revealing sensitive information to anyoneâ€”including validators and contract operators.

---

## Overview

CipherLock transforms how sensitive data is stored and processed on public blockchains. Traditional encrypted storage requires decryption for any operation, exposing data during processing. CipherLock uses Zama FHEVM to perform operations directly on encrypted data, ensuring confidentiality throughout the entire data lifecycle.

**Core Principle**: Data encrypted once, processed infinitely, revealed only by authorized users.

## How It Works

### Storage Workflow

1. **Encryption**: User encrypts data locally using FHE public key
2. **Submission**: Encrypted data sent to smart contract
3. **Storage**: Contract stores encrypted ciphertext on-chain
4. **Verification**: Cryptographic hash ensures data integrity
5. **Access**: Only authorized users can decrypt with private key

### Processing Workflow

1. **Query Formation**: User creates encrypted query parameters
2. **Homomorphic Execution**: Smart contract processes query over encrypted data
3. **Result Generation**: Encrypted results computed without decryption
4. **Delivery**: Encrypted results returned to user
5. **Decryption**: User decrypts results locally with private key

### Access Control Flow

1. **Permission Grant**: Data owner grants access to specific addresses
2. **Key Sharing**: FHE public key distributed to authorized parties
3. **Encrypted Access**: Authorized users can query but not decrypt
4. **Audit Logging**: All access attempts recorded (without revealing data)
5. **Revocation**: Owner can revoke access at any time

## Data Structures

### Encrypted Record

```solidity
struct EncryptedRecord {
    euint8[] data;              // Encrypted data payload
    bytes32 contentHash;       // Hash for integrity verification
    euint64 encryptedSize;     // Encrypted size indicator
    uint256 timestamp;          // Public timestamp
    address owner;              // Record owner
    PermissionSet permissions; // Access control
}
```

### Permission Set

```solidity
struct PermissionSet {
    mapping(address => bool) readAccess;
    mapping(address => bool) writeAccess;
    mapping(address => bool) processAccess;
    uint256 expiration;        // Time-limited access
}
```

## API Reference

### Smart Contract Methods

```solidity
// Store encrypted data
function store(bytes calldata encryptedData, bytes32 hash) external;

// Retrieve encrypted data
function retrieve(uint256 recordId) external view returns (bytes memory);

// Process encrypted query
function processQuery(uint256[] recordIds, bytes calldata encryptedQuery) 
    external returns (bytes memory encryptedResults);

// Grant access
function grantAccess(uint256 recordId, address user, PermissionType perm) external;

```

### JavaScript SDK

```typescript
import { CipherLock } from '@cipherlock/sdk';

const client = new CipherLock({
  provider: window.ethereum,
  contractAddress: '0x...',
});

// Store data
const encrypted = await client.encrypt(data);
await client.store(encrypted, hash);

// Query data
const query = await client.encryptQuery(searchTerm);
const encryptedResults = await client.processQuery([recordId], query);
const results = await client.decrypt(encryptedResults);
```

- **Verify Hashes**: Always verify content hashes on retrieval
- **Manage Keys Securely**: Use hardware wallets for key storage
- **Regular Backups**: Backup encrypted data and keys separately

### Security

- **Access Reviews**: Regularly audit access permissions
- **Monitor Activity**: Watch for unusual access patterns
- **Keep Updated**: Stay current with security patches

### Performance

- **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple operations when possible

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from regular encrypted storage?**  
A: Regular encryption requires decryption to process data. CipherLock uses FHE to process data while it remains encrypted, providing stronger privacy guarantees.

**Q: Can I decrypt data if I lose my private key?**  
A: No. The private key is required for decryption. We recommend secure key backup procedures using hardware wallets or secure key management services.

**Q: How expensive are homomorphic operations?**  
A: FHE operations have higher gas costs than plaintext operations, but CipherLock uses optimization techniques to keep costs reasonable. Typical queries cost 300k-800k gas.

**Q: Is data truly private if it's on a public blockchain?**  
A: Yes. Data is encrypted with FHE before storage. Only encrypted ciphertexts are visible on-chain, and all processing occurs over encrypted data.

**Q: Can multiple people access the same encrypted data?**  
A: Yes, if granted permission. Authorized users receive the FHE public key and can query the encrypted data, but only the data owner can grant decryption access.

**Q: What happens if the FHE keys are compromised?**  
A: Keys are managed using threshold cryptography. Compromising a single key fragment is insufficient. Key rotation procedures allow recovery without data loss.
